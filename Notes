-------Server-------
Is always sending and recieving data, but do it in batches, so it sends 
all the object data at once for all the clients, not having them on seperate threads, this will give the faster computers
an advantage

-------Client-------
Have the Client only send Data when necessary. so any time actions are given to a unit, that is the only time
data should be sent, simply clicking on a unit has no effect on other clients, so is not necessary data. unit commands
are the only data that should be sent the the server

-------Server-------
Is always sending and recieving data, but do it in batches, so it sends 
all the object data at once for all the clients, not having them on seperate threads, this will give the faster computers
an advantage

-------Client-------
Have the Client only send Data when necessary. so any time actions are given to a unit, that is the only time
data should be sent, simply clicking on a unit has no effect on other clients, so is not necessary data. unit commands
are the only data that should be sent the the server

At first I thought I woud have to seperate the incoming data on the client side based on the different Clients.
I have now realized I can just assign an id to the unit with its team and other data needed. the client is just a visual
representation of what is occuring on the server
